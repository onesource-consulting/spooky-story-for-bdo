# Echoes in the Static

A browser-based text horror game built with React, Tailwind CSS, and Framer Motion.

## Story

You are a radio operator trapped during a storm at Remote Outpost #12. Your shift has just begun, but something is wrong. The radio picks up signals that shouldn't exist. Voices that sound... off. As your sanity deteriorates, reality itself begins to unravel.

## Gameplay

Each turn, you can choose one of three actions:

1. **Scan Frequency** - Tune to a random radio frequency and listen to transmissions
2. **Reply** - Respond to the last transmission you received (risky!)
3. **Investigate** - Explore different parts of the outpost

The game features:
- üé≠ Unreliable narration that intensifies as your sanity drops
- üìª 10 different frequency types with unique transmissions
- üèöÔ∏è 6 investigation locations with disturbing discoveries
- üëª Random eerie events that occur during gameplay
- üíÄ Multiple ways to meet your doom
- üé® Atmospheric CRT monitor visual effects
